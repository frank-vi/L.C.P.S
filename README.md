The project was developed for the Deep Learning course with the dual objective of:
- classify rx images using four labels: covid, lung opacity, viral pneumonia and normal.
- identify the portion of the rx images containing the pneumothorax by image segmentation.

To achieve these goals, my team and I have implemented and trained various Deep Neural Networks:
- for the classification task: ResNet, VGG and Inception;
- instead, for the segmentation task: DeepLab and U-Net.
